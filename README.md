### What I Do

Throughout my career, I've engaged in various projects, including the development of features for call center platforms, HR platforms, and event management platforms. In a previous role, I contributed to the development and evolution of Pix and the DICT system, working at a financial technology company that interfaced directly with the Central Bank of Brazil. I helped implement core functionalities of Brazil's real-time payments infrastructure, ensuring compliance with regulatory and technical standards.

Currently, I‚Äôm part of the team at Stone, working as a back-end developer in the boletos domain, using Elixir (with Phoenix) and Go. My work involves building and maintaining services that support core banking operations ‚Äî such as generating reports for the Central Bank‚Äôs open accounts system (CCS) ‚Äî with a strong focus on automation, reliability, and regulatory compliance.

On the technical side, I work extensively with Kafka, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes, building distributed, event-driven systems that are both scalable and fault-tolerant. I also leverage observability tools like OpenTelemetry, Grafana, and Prometheus to ensure visibility and performance across our services. My daily routine involves handling high-throughput data, resilient architectures, and the complexities of financial integrations in a regulated environment.
